## ✨ Highlights

- Designed and built around **real-world animal rescue needs and workflows**, based on **in-depth research and interviews with industry practitioners**

- Uses a **Monorepo architecture** for project management, centralizing frontend, backend, and shared code to ensure consistent standards and provide a solid foundation for **long-term planning, multi-party collaboration, and sustainable evolution**

- From the very beginning, the system is designed for **multi-role collaboration**, enabling volunteers, rescue organizations, and community adopters to participate and form a collaborative rescue ecosystem

- The frontend architecture is designed with **core feature modularization** from the outset, splitting reporting, tracking, and story-sharing into independently manageable modules to support **future multi-maintainer development and feature expansion**

- The backend follows a **classic microservices-oriented design**, ensuring long-term **maintainability and scalability**
