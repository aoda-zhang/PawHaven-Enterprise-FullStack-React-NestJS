# 🛠 Development Guide

This document explains how to run **PawHaven** locally for development.
The project is organized as a **monorepo** containing both frontend and backend applications.

You can run the full system or start each part independently.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **pnpm**
- **MongoDB** (local or remote instance)

> If MongoDB is not running, the backend will fail to start.

## Install Dependencies

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
```
